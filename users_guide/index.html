<p>All menus and a search bar are displayed across the top. The main page has two columns, showing current workshops and in progress workshops.  This view can be filtered to show workshops assigned to the logged in administrator, another administrator, or unassigned workshops.</p>
<p><img alt="AMY dashboard" src="images/amy_dashboard.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Current workshops</em> have a complete start and end date, a valid url, and a complete location.</li>
<li><em>In progress workshops</em> are all workshops that do not meet these criteria.</li>
</ul>
<p>Current Data, Library, and Software Carpentry workshops will be listed on The Carpentries website, the corresponding lesson program website, and The Carpentries data feeds if the box to publish the workshop is checked.  Instructor Training events are not publicly listed.</p>
<p>From here you can also add new <a href="#adding-a-new-person">persons</a>, <a href="#adding-a-new-event">events</a>, <a href="#adding-a-new-organisation">organisations</a>, or <a href="#adding-a-new-airport">airports</a> to the database.</p>

Enter in the domain (full website, such as <code>https://www.example.com/library</code>).  When known, enter in the country and latitude/longitude of the main location.

<h3 id="adding-a-new-membership">Adding a New Membership<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-a-new-membership" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>AMY is also used to track all Carpentries memberships.  To create a new membership, the site must first be listed as an <a href="#adding-a-new-organisation">organisation</a> in AMY.</p>
<p>Select "Memberships" from the top menu bar to view a <a href="https://amy.carpentries.org/fiscal/memberships/">list of all Memberships</a>. Memberships can be searched by Organisation name, Consortium status, Public/Private listing, Variant, Contribution type, Active status, and allowed or remaining training seats.</p>
<p>New Memberships can be created one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>If this is an entirely new membership, click on the "New Membership" button at the top of the <a href="https://amy.carpentries.org/fiscal/memberships/">membership page</a>. This will take you to a blank new membership form.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="AMY add new membership" src="images/amy_new_membership.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>If this is a <a href="#renewing-memberships">renewal of a current membership</a>, select that membership and click on the green "Create new &amp; roll-over button" at the bottom of that page.  This will take you to a new membership form with some information pre-populated.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="AMY membership rollover" src="images/membership_rollover.png" /></p>
<p>The following fields are included in the Member view:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> The name of the membership.  If this is a single organisation, it will be that organisation's name.  If it is a consortium of several organisations, it will be their collective name.</li>
<li><strong>Consortium</strong>  If this box is checked, you will be able to assign multiple organisations to that membership.  If not, you will only be able to assign one organisation to that membership.</li>
<li><strong>Can this membership be publicized on The Carpentries websites</strong> If Public is selected, the membership will be listed on <a href="https://carpentries.org/members/">The Carpentries Members page</a> and <a href="https://feeds.carpentries.org/all_public_memberships.json">data feeds</a>.  If Private is selected, it will not be listed.</li>
<li><strong>Variant</strong> This lists all the membership levels (Gold, Silver, Bronze, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Agreement start</strong> and <strong>Agreement end</strong> Start and end dates of the membership agreement.  A notification displays if the membership is not approximately one year long.</li>
<li><strong>Extensions</strong> Extensions are created using the "Extend" button at the bottom of the main membership page. The duration of the extension can be edited here.</li>
<li><strong>Contribution type</strong> What the member contribution was (Financial, Person-days, or other)</li>
<li><strong>Registration code</strong> A unique registration code used to unlock <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/training_calendar/index.html">Instructor Training registration in Eventbrite</a> and match up the trainee's application to this membership. These are not automated. Eventbrite registration is manually set up within Eventbrite. Instructor training applications using the member code are <a href="#accepting-trainee-applications">manually matched to this member and a training event</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Link to member agreement</strong> Link to the Google Drive folder with the member agreement.</li>
<li><strong>Workshops without admin fee per agreement</strong> Number of workshops allowed in the terms of the agreement.</li>
<li><strong>Public instructor training seats</strong> Number of public instructor training seats allowed in the terms of the agreement.</li>
<li><strong>Additional public instructor training seats</strong> Number of additional public seats the member may have purchased beyond the standard agreement.</li>
<li><strong>In-house instructor training seats</strong> Number of in-house instructor training seats allowed in the terms of the agreement. This will typically only apply to Platinum memberships.</li>
<li><strong>Additional in-house instructor training seats</strong>  Number of additional in-house seats the member may have purchased beyond the standard agreement.  This will typically only apply to Platinum memberships.</li>
<li><strong>Emergency contact</strong> Free text field to fill in emergency contact information.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="consortium-memberships">Consortium Memberships<a class="headerlink" href="#consortium-memberships" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>If <em>Consortium</em> is checked, additional affiliated sites can be added to that membership.  These will display in the <code>Organisations (members)</code> line of the Member view. For single-site memberships, only the main site can be listed here.  For consortium memberships, additional member sites can be added in.  These sites must first be <a href="#adding-a-new-organisation">listed as an organisation in AMY</a>.</p>
<h4 id="membership-contacts">Membership Contacts<a class="headerlink" href="#membership-contacts" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>Once a new membership has been created, contact people can be assigned to the membership.  Contact people can have one of two roles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Billing Contact</strong> Person responsible for contracts and invoicing.</li>
<li><strong>Programmatic Contact</strong> Person responsible for coordination of workshops and instructor training</li>
</ul>
<p>When a new membership is created, a new field called <code>Persons</code> will display. Click <code>Edit</code> in this row to add or edit any contacts. Multiple contacts can have the same role; one contact can have both roles. Existing contacts will be listed here. These Persons must first be <a href="#adding-a-new-person">listed as a Person in AMY</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="AMY Membership Contacts" src="images/membership_persons.png" /></p>
<h4 id="extending-membership-dates">Extending membership dates<a class="headerlink" href="#extending-membership-dates" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>If a membership is granted an extension to the membership date terms, do not change the original membership end date.  Instead, click the gray "Extend" button at the bottom of the membership view. Enter in the new membership end date.  The number of days of the extension will automatically be calculated.  Add in any comments, such as the context for the extension or a link to more information. Multiple extensions can be granted. The duration of the extension can be edited in the membership's edit view.  If a second extension is granted, do not edit the original. Instead, click on the gray "Extend" button again to enter in another extension.</p>
<p><img alt="AMY Membership Extension Button" src="images/membership_extension_button.png" />  </p>
<p><img alt="Record Membership Extension" src="images/membership_extension.png" /></p>
<h4 id="renewing-memberships">Renewing memberships<a class="headerlink" href="#renewing-memberships" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>When a member site renews a membership, do not create a new member record. Instead, click the green "Create new &amp; roll-over" button at the bottom of the membership view. A new member view will appear, with the following fields pre-populated. Any of these values can be edited.  A membership can be rolled over only once.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong>: Same as previous</li>
<li><strong>Can this membership be publicized?</strong>: Same as previous</li>
<li><strong>Variant</strong>: Same as previous</li>
<li><strong>Agreement start</strong> and <strong>Agreement end</strong> Starts on end date of previous membership; ends one year from start</li>
<li><strong>Contribution type</strong>: Same as previous</li>
<li><strong>Instructor training seats and workshops allowed</strong>: Same as previous or standard amounts allowed for that membership</li>
</ul>
<p>This also includes the options to automatically copy over member organisations (for consortiums only) and copy over associated persons and their roles.</p>
<p>The number of workshops or instructor training seats rolled over from the previous membership should be manually entered.  These workshop/instructor training seats counts will be reflected in the available counts for both the new and previous memberships.</p>
<h3 id="adding-a-new-person">Adding a New Person<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-a-new-person" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>If a person's record does not exist in the database, it can be added individually or as part of a bulk upload.</p>
<h4 id="adding-an-individual-person-record">Adding an Individual Person Record<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-an-individual-person-record" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>Select "New person" and enter in as much information as possible.  At minimum a personal name is required.  If the airport is not listed, it will need to be <a href="#adding-a-new-airport">added in</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="AMY add new person" src="images/new_person.png" /></p>
<h4 id="adding-bulk-person-records">Adding Bulk Person Records<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-bulk-person-records" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p><code>Person</code> records can also be added in bulk from a <code>.csv</code> file using the <code>Bulk add persons</code> menu option in the  <code>New</code> menu at the top right or the <code>More</code> menu. Use the blank template to generate a well formed CSV noting each person's personal name, family name (optional), email address (optional), role, and associated event. Any additional information about the person must be entered manually.  <strong>Note: To bulk add records, the persons must have a role specified (instructor, helper, learner, host) associated with a specific event</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="AMY bulk add person menu" src="images/bulk_add_persons.png" /></p>
<p>The role must exactly match the <a href="https://amy.carpentries.org/workshops/persons/bulk_upload/">instructions here</a>. The event slug must exactly match the slug for the event recorded in AMY.</p>
<p>This will take you to a screen where you can verify each record, correct any errors, and submit them for bulk upload.  If a person with the same name and email already exists in the database, you will be able to match the new entry to the existing record.  Otherwise a new person record will be created.</p>
<h4 id="consents">Consents<a class="headerlink" href="#consents" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>AMY asks all users to consent or agree to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I have read and agree to the data privacy policy of The Carpentries.</strong></li>
<li><strong>May contact</strong></li>
<li><strong>Consent to making profile public</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do you consent to have your name or identity associated with lesson publications?</strong></li>

<p>By default, all consents have null values (i.e., neither yes nor no). After a Person's record has been created, the individual can log in to AMY and edit their own consents. Admin users may also make these edits on behalf of the user, but this should be used only in rare circumstances. Consents are edited in a separate tab in the Person view. </p>
<h3 id="adding-a-new-airport">Adding a New Airport<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-a-new-airport" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Airports are used as approximate geographic identifiers for our instructors.  Instructors can self-select the airport closest to them or the airport they most frequently use. Instructors can select an airport only after it has been added to AMY by an admin.  Each airport is identified by its three character IATA code which can be looked up using <a href="https://www.world-airport-codes.com/">the link in AMY</a>.</p>
<p>Enter in the airport's IATA code, full name, country, and latitude and longitude.</p>

<p>A workshop can be requested from a host site, and this information can be used to create an event in AMY. In the "Requests" menu, select one of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workshop requests</li>
<li>Workshop inquiries</li>
<li>Self-Organised submissions</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="AMY workshop requests" src="images/workshop_requests_menu.png" /></p>
<p>This will take you to a summary view of the workshop requests, workshop inquiries, or self-organised submissions.  Click on the "information" icon at the right of each row to see more details.</p>
<p><img alt="AMY workshop request list" src="images/workshop_requests.png" /></p>
<p>At the bottom of the request information page, the user has the option to accept or discard the request. All requests should be accepted (unless spam or otherwise inappropriate) so The Carpentries can maintain a history of workshop requests. Events can later be tagged as stalled or cancelled. Choosing "Change state to Accepted" will mark it as accepted in the workshop request list but will not create a new event. Select "Accept and create a new event" to create a new event from this request. </p>
<p>This will open a page with a side by side view of the request details and view to create a new event, similar to the general new event page. The new event can be created <a href="#creating-a-new-event-manually">manually</a> or if available, <a href="#creating-a-new-event-from-url">from the URL</a>, as described above.</p>

<li><strong>Title</strong> and <strong>URL</strong> are not used in this context.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a person's name does not appear in the dropdown, they will need to be <a href="#adding-a-new-person">added to the database</a>.</p>
<p>If this is a learner role at an Instructor Training event, the following fields should also be filled in.  These fields apply only to Instructor Training, and can be left blank for other types of events.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Associated member site in TTT event</strong> Note the membership (institution name and membership year) that this seat should be assigned to.</li>
<li><strong>Count seat as public or in-house?</strong> Note whether the learner seat should be counted as public or inhouse.  Most seats will be public. Inhouse only applies to select Platinum level memberships.</li>

<p>In addition to tracking workshops, AMY also allows us to track applications to instructor training events. <a href="https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/request_training/">The public facing application is here</a>. Applicants are given a registration code if participating in a member training event and should select "Profile Creation for Pre-approved Trainees" using this code. Open applicants will not have a registration code.</p>
<p>Once an individual submits the form, they receive an email that confirms their application has been received and includes a copy of the individual's responses. An admin user can then view the record by going to Requests --&gt; <a href="https://amy.carpentries.org/requests/training_requests/">Training Requests</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Training request menu" src="images/training_request_menu.png" /></p>
<p>Applications can then be searched by individual name, email address, group (registration code), status (pending, accepted, discarded, or withdrawn), affiliation, or location.  Affiliation and location searches rely on text strings, so <em>UCLA</em> will not return <em>University of California Los Angeles</em> and <em>Joburg ZA</em> will not return <em>Johannesburg</em> or <em>South Africa</em>.</p>
<p>Some trainees will already be in AMY. If there is a record with a matching name and email address, they will show up with a "matched trainee" when you search for them. You can match the application to this trainee, or if the match was incorrect, search for a different Person record or create a new Person.</p>
<p><img alt="Match trainee to person" src="images/match_trainee.png" /></p>
<p>If "matched trainee" is blank, you will need to create a new person record for them.  To create a trainee record, click on the "i" icon at the far right of the individual's line. If you know this person is in AMY under a different name or email address, look this person up here and click "Match to selected trainee account."  If this is a new person, click "Create new trainee account."  This will create a new Person record for that trainee.</p>
<p><img alt="AMY Trainee no match" src="images/trainee_no_match.png" /></p>
<p>This will return you to the <a href="https://amy.carpentries.org/requests/training_requests/">instructor training application search screen</a>, and this person's record will be updated with the new trainee account.</p>
<p>Continue doing this until all relevant applications have a new trainee account. This must be done individually; it can not be done in bulk.</p>
<p>Once all trainees for a given event have trainee accounts, we can assign them to a specific training event and associate them with a specific member contract. This part can be done in bulk for each group of trainees with a unique training date and member site affiliation. The <a href="#adding-a-new-event">event</a> and the <a href="#memberships">member agreement</a> must already have been created in AMY.</p>
<p>Check all the names to be assigned to the training event and membership, and then select the training event from the first drop down menu.  Select the member agreement from the second drop down menu. If the trainees are coming through the open application process rather than a member agreement, check this box instead of choosing a member agreement.</p>
<p>Click "Accept &amp; match selected trainees to chosen training." The search screen will then update to show that the trainees have been matched to this event. The event page will also update to list these trainees as learners at that event.</p>

<p>If duplicate Person, Training Request, or Event records exist, they can be merged.  If you know which two records should be merged, you can select them directly.  You can also search for possible duplicate records.</p>

<p><img alt="AMY merge duplicates menu" src="images/merge_menu.png" /></p>
<p>Once you select "Merge Persons" or "Merge Events" you will be taken to a screen to select the two Persons or Events you would like to merge. Start typing in the Person's name or the Event's slug, and AMY will autocomplete with possible options.</p>
<p><img alt="AMY select Persons to merge" src="images/select_merge_persons.png" /></p>
<p>This will take you to a screen listing all the information in that Person's record, and allowing you to choose whether to keep the values in record A or record B.  For fields allowing multiple values (such as event tasks), you will also have the option to combine (include all values).  Click "Submit" on the bottom of this screen to complete the merge process.</p>

<h5 id="searching-for-possible-duplicate-person-or-training-request-records">Searching for possible duplicate Person or Training Request records<a class="headerlink" href="#searching-for-possible-duplicate-person-or-training-request-records" title="Permanent link"></a></h5>
<p>If you want to check for duplicate Person or Training Requests in general, you can review a list of possible duplicate records. Select the appropriate option from the "Reports" menu.</p>
<p><img alt="AMY find duplicates menu" src="images/find_duplicate_menu.png" /></p>
<p>Here, you will see two lists:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Possible duplicate persons</strong>. This will include records where another record exists with the personal and family names switched, or a single person with the same personal and family name.  </li>
<li><strong>Persons with the same names</strong>.  This compares people with the same personal and family names.  </li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, if these records should be merged, select records A and B.  This will take you to the Merge Persons screen (see above).  If these individuals are not the same person, select "Mark as Reviewed" and they will not show up in the list of possible duplicates again.</p>

<h4 id="general-search">General Search<a class="headerlink" href="#general-search" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>The quickest and easiest way to search is using the search box in the top menu bar. This will perform a case insensitive search of any field in AMY, including searching for partial matches. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>12-12-</code> will match any workshop slug containing that string (essentially any workshop on December 12 of any year.)</li>
<li><code>ola tes</code> will match <code>Nikola Tesla</code> and <code>Nolan Bates</code></li>
<li><code>stanford</code> will match any one with a <code>stanford</code> email address, with <code>stanford</code> in their name, any workshops with <code>stanford</code> in the slug, or the site <code>Stanford University</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If only one result is found across all fields, AMY will automatically redirect to that result.  Otherwise, AMY will redirect to a search results view.  The search results view will include a new search box, with results appearing in a tabbed view, separated by Organisations, Memberships, Events, Persons, Airports, Training Requests, and Comments.</p>
<p><a href="https://amy.carpentries.org/dashboard/admin/search/">This search view can also be accessed directly from the More menu</a>.</p>
